\title{Methylation values around BLK gene}
\format{The data comes in three objects:
\describe{
\item{methylation}{Matrix of methylation values at 6,000 sites measured on 40 samples}
\item{pheno}{Vector of phenotype, indicating whether the sample comes from a B cell}
\item{position2}{Data frame recording the position of each CpG site along the BLK region}

\description{
A dataset containing methylation values for cell-separated samples. The
methylation was measured using bisulfite sequencing. The data also contains
the genomic position of these CpG sites, as well as a binary phenotype
(whether the sample comes from a B cell).
}
\details{
Methylation was first measured at 24,068 sites, on 40 samples. Filtering was
performed to keep the 25\% most variable sites. See the vignette for more detail.
