# PCEV

R package which implements Principal components of explained variance (PCEV).

PCEV is a statistical tool for the analysis of a mutivariate response vector. It is a dimension-reduction technique, similar to Principal Components Analysis (PCA), which seeks to maximize the proportion of variance (in the response vector) being explained by a set of covariates.
