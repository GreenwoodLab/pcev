Description: Principal component of explained variance (PCEV) is a statistical
    tool for the analysis of a multivariate response vector. It is a dimension-
    reduction technique, similar to Principal component analysis (PCA), which seeks
    the maximize the proportion of variance (in the response vector) being explained
    by a set of covariates.
