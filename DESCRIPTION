Description: PCEV is a statistical tool for the analysis of a multivariate
    response vector. It is a dimension-reduction technique, similar to Principal
    Components Analysis (PCA), which seeks the maximize the proportion of
    variance (in the response vector) being explained by a set of covariates.
